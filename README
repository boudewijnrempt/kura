
Kura, the linguistics database application 


Kura is a multi-user open-source linguistics database application especially
geared towards language description. Read the proposal for a description of
the intended functionality and the preliminary design. 

Kura is a complex application: please read the installation guide for your
platform (INSTALL for Unix/X11, install_on_windows.txt for Windows). Please,
read the manual, too!

However, if you have problems, feel free to contact me:

     boud@rempt.xs4all.nl

If you want to contribute to Kura, you're very welcome. Either scratch your
own itch, or take a look at the TODO list.
